## Project Overview

Browsi Admin Dashboard is a web application designed for Browsi's admin-level users to oversee their publishers, domains, and monetization strategies. It provides a user-friendly interface to manage and view publisher data efficiently.

## Features

- Add new publishers
- View domain details including desktop and mobile ad counts
- Persistent data storage

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular 17
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: JSON file (for demonstration purposes)

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Get Publishers**: Implemented fetching publishers from the backend and displaying them in the frontend.
2. **Add Publisher Button**: Added functionality to create new publishers from the frontend.
3. **Fix DB Bug**: Implemented data persistence to ensure publisher data is saved between server restarts.
4. **Get Domains**: Completed the implementation to fetch and display domain information for each publisher.
